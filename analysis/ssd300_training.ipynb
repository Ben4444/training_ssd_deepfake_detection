    "Note that the generator provides two options to speed up the training. By default, it loads the individual images for a batch from disk. This has two disadvantages. First, for compressed image formats like JPG, this is a huge computational waste, because every image needs to be decompressed again and again every time it is being loaded. Second, the images on disk are likely not stored in a contiguous block of memory, which may also slow down the loading process. The first option that `DataGenerator` provides to deal with this is to load the entire dataset into memory, which reduces the access time for any image to a negligible amount, but of course this is only an option if I have enough free memory to hold the whole dataset. As a second option, `DataGenerator` provides the possibility to convert the dataset into a single HDF5 file. This HDF5 file stores the images as uncompressed arrays in a contiguous block of memory, which dramatically speeds up the loading time. It's not as good as having the images in memory, but it's a lot better than the default option of loading them from their compressed JPG state every time they are needed. Of course such an HDF5 dataset may require significantly more disk space than the compressed images. I can later load these HDF5 datasets directly in the constructor.\n",

    "We've already chosen an optimizer and set the batch size above, now let's set the remaining training parameters. We'll set one epoch to consist of 11,000 training steps. The next code cell defines a learning rate schedule that approximates the learning rate schedule of the original Caffe implementation for the training of the SSD300 Pascal VOC \"07+12\" model. That model was trained for 120,000 steps with a learning rate of 0.001 for the first 80,000 steps, 0.0001 for the next 20,000 steps, and 0.00001 for the last 20,000 steps. If I'm training on a different dataset, I can define the learning rate schedule however I see fit: In this case, I will train for 15 epochs, which corresponds to 165,000 steps. I will use a learning rate of 0.001 for the first 88,000 steps, 0.0001 for the next 44,000 steps, and 0.00001 for the last 33,000 steps.\n",

It also makes sense to continuously stream our training history to a CSV log file after every epoch, because if we didn't do that, in case the training terminates with an exception at some point or if the kernel of this Jupyter notebook dies for some reason or anything like that happens, we would lose the entire history for the trained epochs. Finally, we'll also add a callback that makes sure that the training terminates if the loss becomes `NaN`. Depending on the optimizer I use, it can happen that the loss becomes `NaN` during the first iterations of the training. In later iterations it's less of a risk. For example, a `NaN` loss when training a SSD using an Adam optimizer has never been seen, but an `NaN` loss has been seen a couple of times during the very first couple of hundred training steps of training a new model using an SGD optimizer."

    "In order to utilize the full training dataset and approximate the training of the \"07+12\" model mentioned above, I will train 11,000 steps per epoch for 15 epochs. At 11,000 steps, each epoch is expected to take 14 hours 10 minutes running on a K80 GPU. Training for 15 epochs, this corresponds to 165,000 steps trained over 212.5 hours, or approximately 9 days.

    "In order to only run a partial training and resume smoothly later on, there are a few things to note:\n",
    "1. Always load the full model if I can, rather than building a new model and loading previously saved weights into it. Optimizers like SGD or Adam keep running averages of past gradient moments internally. If I always save and load full models when resuming a training, then the state of the optimizer is maintained and the training picks up exactly where it left off. If I build a new model and load weights into it, the optimizer is being initialized from scratch, which, especially in the case of Adam, leads to small but unnecessary setbacks every time I resume the training with previously saved weights.\n",
    "2. In order for the learning rate scheduler callback above to work properly, `fit_generator()` needs to know which epoch we're in, otherwise it will start with epoch 0 every time I resume the training. Set `initial_epoch` to be the next epoch of my training. Note that this parameter is zero-based, i.e. the first epoch is epoch 0. If I had trained for 10 epochs previously and now I want to resume the training from there, I'd set `initial_epoch = 10` (since epoch 10 is the eleventh epoch). Furthermore, set `final_epoch` to the last epoch I want to run. To stick with the previous example, if I had trained for 10 epochs previously and now I want to train for another 10 epochs, I'd set `initial_epoch = 10` and `final_epoch = 20`.\n",
    "3. If I'm only saving the best models, in order for the model checkpoint callback above to work correctly after a kernel restart, set `model_checkpoint.best` to the best validation loss from the previous training. If I don't do this and a new `ModelCheckpoint` object is created after a kernel restart, that object obviously won't know what the last best validation loss was, so it will always save the weights of the first epoch of my new training and record that loss as its new best loss."
